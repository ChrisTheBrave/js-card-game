# Card Game

A simple card game: War.
This card game is by Christine Ash.
The goal of this was to practice utilizing "Arrays, Objects, iteration, and composing functions together into larger applications."
I was required to edit two Javascript files: one to create the deck of cards and another to play the actual game.
